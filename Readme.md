# STM32CubeMP13 MPU Firmware Package

**STM32Cube** is an STMicroelectronics original initiative to ease the developers life by reducing efforts, time and cost.

**STM32Cube** covers the overall STM32 products portfolio. It includes a comprehensive embedded software platform (this repo), delivered for each series (such as the STM32CubeMP13 for the STM32MP13 series).
   * The CMSIS modules (core and device) corresponding to the Arm<sup>®</sup> core implemented in this STM32 product
   * The STM32 HAL-LL drivers, an abstraction layer offering a set of APIs ensuring maximized portability across the STM32 portfolio.
   * The BSP Driver of DISCO board provided for this STM32 series 
   * A consistent set of middleware libraries such as ThreadX, FileX, USBX, NetDuoX, USB Library 
   * A full set of software projects (basic examples, applications, and templates)  for DISCO board provided by this STM32 series.
   * A development with a Toolchain and Compiler (STM32CubeIDE).
      
The **STM32CubeMP13 MPU Package** projects are directly running on Arm<sup>®</sup>Cortex<sup>®</sup>-A7 of the STM32MP13 series boards. You can find in each Projects/*Board name* directories a set of software projects.

## Boards available
  * STM32MP13 DISCO (STM32MP135F-DK )
