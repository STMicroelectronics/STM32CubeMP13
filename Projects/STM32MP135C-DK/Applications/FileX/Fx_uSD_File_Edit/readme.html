<h2 id="fx_usd_file_edit-application-description"><b>Fx_uSD_File_Edit
application description</b></h2>
<p>This application provides an example of Azure RTOS FileX stack usage
on STM32MP135F-DK board, it shows how to develop a basic SD card
file</p>
<p>operations application. The application is designed to handle SD card
insertion/removal events, and depending on that state, it starts</p>
<p>and stops file operations from and into the SD card.</p>
<p>The main entry function, tx_application_define(), is called by
ThreadX during kernel start. At this stage, all FileX resources are
initialized,</p>
<p>the SD card detection event is registered and drivers are
initialized.</p>
<p>A single thread is created:</p>
<ul>
<li>fx_thread (Prio : 10; PreemptionPrio : 10) used to initialize the SD
driver and starting FileX’s file operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>A message queue is used to signal the SD card detection event to the
fx_thread thread:</p>
<ul>
<li>tx_msg_queue (Msg size : 1 (UINT); total messages : 16) used to
notify the fx_thread about the SD card insertion status.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fx_thread starts by checking whether the SD card is initially
inserted or not. In the true case, it sends a message to the queue to
ensure</p>
<p>that the first iteration starts properly. The wait on the message
queue blocks till it receives a new message about whether the SD card is
inserted</p>
<p>or removed. Interrupt callback for SD detection is registered and it
is used to send the event information to the message queue.</p>
<p>The fx_thread uses FileX services to open the SD media for file
operations and attempt to create file STM32.TXT. If the file exists
already,</p>
<p>it will be overwritten. Dummy content is then written into the file
and it is closed. The file is opened once again in read mode and
content</p>
<p>is checked if matches what was previously written.</p>
<h4 id="expected-success-behavior"><b>Expected success behavior</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>A file named STM32.TXT should be visible in the root directory of
the SD card.</li>
<li>A blinking green LED light marks the success of the file
operations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="error-behaviors"><b>Error behaviors</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>On failure, the red LED should start blinking.</li>
<li>Error handler is called at the spot where the error occurred.</li>

<h3 id="notes"><b>Notes</b></h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Before starting the application :</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The DDR memory need to be initialized with DDR_Init project.</li>
<li>The SD card should be present in the SD card connector and formatted
initially by user.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="threadx-usage-hints"><b>ThreadX usage hints</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>ThreadX uses the Systick as time base, thus it is mandatory that the
HAL uses a separate time base through the TIM IPs.</li>
<li>ThreadX is configured with 100 ticks/sec by default, this should be
taken into account when using delays or timeouts at application. It is
always possible to reconfigure it in the “tx_user.h”, the
“TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND” define,but this should be reflected in
“tx_initialize_low_level.s” file too.</li>
<li>ThreadX is disabling all interrupts during kernel start-up to avoid
any unexpected behavior, therefore all system related calls (HAL, BSP)
should be done either at the beginning of the application or inside the
thread entry functions.</li>
<li>ThreadX offers the “tx_application_define()” function, that is
automatically called by the tx_kernel_enter() API. It is highly
recommended to use it to create all applications ThreadX related
resources (threads, semaphores, memory pools…) but it should not in any
way contain a system API call (HAL or BSP).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="filexlevelx-usage-hints"><b>FileX/LevelX usage hints</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>When calling the fx_media_format() API, it is highly recommended to
understand all the parameters used by the API to correctly generate a
valid filesystem.</li>
<li>FileX is using data buffers, passed as arguments to fx_media_open(),
fx_media_read() and fx_media_write() API it is recommended that these
buffers are multiple of sector size and “32 bytes” aligned to avoid
cache maintenance issues.</li>

environment</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>This application runs on STM32MP135xx devices.</li>
<li>This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics
STM32MP135F-DK boards. and can be easily tailored to any other supported
device and development board.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-use-it"><b>How to use it ?</b></h3>
<p>In order to make the program work, you must do the following :</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your preferred toolchain</li>
<li>Rebuid and run DDR_Init example to initialize the DDR memory</li>
<li>Rebuild all Fx_uSD_File_Edit_A7 files and load your image into
target memory</li>
<li>Run the application</li>
</ul>
