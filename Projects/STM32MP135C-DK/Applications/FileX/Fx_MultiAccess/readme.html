<h2 id="fx_multiaccess-application-description"><b>Fx_MultiAccess
application description</b></h2>
<p>This application provides an example of Azure RTOS FileX stack usage
on STM32MP135F-DK board, it demonstrates the FileX’s concurrent file
access capabilities. The application is designed to execute file
operations on the SD card device, the code provides all required
software code for handling SD card I/O operations.</p>
<p>The application starts by calling the ThreadX’s initialization
routine which creates multithreaded environment for starting the
concurrent FileX’s two main threads that handle file operations. At this
stage, all FileX resources are created, the SDIO driver is initialized
and the application creates 3 threads with the same priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li>fx_thread_main (Prio : 10; PreemptionPrio : 10) used to initialize
the SD card driver and opening it as a FileX Media.</li>
<li>fx_thread_one (Prio : 10; PreemptionPrio : 10) used to create, write
and read operations for file fx_file_one.</li>
<li>fx_thread_two (Prio : 10; PreemptionPrio : 10) used to create, write
and read operations for file fx_file_two.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b>: A FAT32 compatible SD card is expected to be used with
this example. The program will start file operations without formatting
the media, so all user related files are kept.</p>
<h4 id="expected-success-behavior"><b>Expected success behavior</b></h4>
<p>When an SD card is inserted into the STM32MP135F-DK SD card reader
and the board is powered up, the application starts file operations.</p>
<p>During the start phase, the main thread starts by opening the SD card
using FileX media open service. Upon successful opening of the media and
its underlying FAT32 file</p>
<p>system, the main thread starts the two file operations threads,
fx_thread_one and fx_thread_two. The two threads then start file
operations, each at a different file.</p>
<p>This demonstrates the concurrent access handling capabilities of
FileX, without the need for an external access-aribitration locks.</p>
<p>Successful operation is marked by a toggling green LED light.</p>
<h4 id="error-behaviors"><b>Error behaviors</b></h4>
<p>On failure, the red LED starts toggling while the green LED is
switched OFF.</p>
<h4 id="assumptions-if-any"><b>Assumptions if any</b></h4>
<p>Hotplug is not implemented for this application, the SD card is
expected to be inserted before application start.</p>
<h4 id="known-limitations"><b>Known limitations</b></h4>
<p>The value defined for USE_SD_TRANSCEIVER need to be set to 0U in the
HAL system configuration section in the header file
“FileX/Fx_MultiAccess/Core/Inc/stm32h7xx_hal_conf.h”.</p>
<h3 id="notes"><b>Notes</b></h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Before starting the application :</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The DDR memory need to be initialized with DDR_Init project.</li>
<li>The SD card should be present in the SD card connector and formatted
initially by user.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="threadx-usage-hints"><b>ThreadX usage hints</b></h4>
<p>ThreadX uses the Systick as time base, thus it is mandatory that the
HAL uses a separate time base through the TIM IPs. - ThreadX is
configured with 100 ticks/sec by default, this should be taken into
account when using delays or timeouts at application. It is always
possible to reconfigure it in the “tx_user.h”, the
“TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND” define,but this should be reflected in
“tx_initialize_low_level.s” file too. - ThreadX is disabling all
interrupts during kernel start-up to avoid any unexpected behavior,
therefore all system related calls (HAL, BSP) should be done either at
the beginning of the application or inside the thread entry functions. -
ThreadX offers the “tx_application_define()” function, that is
automatically called by the tx_kernel_enter() API. It is highly
recommended to use it to create all applications ThreadX related
resources (threads, semaphores, memory pools…) but it should not in any
way contain a system API call (HAL or BSP).</p>
<h4 id="filexlevelx-usage-hints"><b>FileX/LevelX usage hints</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>When calling the fx_media_format() API, it is highly recommended to
understand all the parameters used by the API to correctly generate a
valid filesystem.</li>
<li>FileX is using data buffers, passed as arguments to fx_media_open(),
fx_media_read() and fx_media_write() API it is recommended that these
buffers are multiple of sector size and “32 bytes” aligned to avoid
cache maintenance issues.</li>

<ul>
<li>This example runs on STM32MP135xx devices.</li>
<li>This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32MP135F-DK
boards. and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and
development board.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-use-it"><b>How to use it ?</b></h3>
<p>In order to make the program work, you must do the following :</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your preferred toolchain</li>
<li>Rebuid and run DDR_Init example to initialize the DDR memory</li>
<li>Rebuild all Fx_MultiAccess_A7 files and load your image into target
memory</li>
<li>Run the application</li>
</ul>
