id="tx_thread_creation-application-description"><b>Tx_Thread_Creation
application description</b></h2>
<p>This application provides an example of Azure RTOS ThreadX stack
usage, it shows how to develop an application using the ThreadX thread
management APIs. It demonstrates how to create and destroy multiple
threads using Azure RTOS ThreadX APIs. In addition, it shows how to use
preemption threshold between threads and change priorities on-fly. The
main entry function tx_application_define() is then called by ThreadX
during kernel start, at this stage, the application creates 3 threads
with different priorities :</p>
<ul>
<li>MainThread (Prio : 5; Preemption Threshold : 5)</li>
<li>ThreadOne (Prio : 10; Preemption Threshold : 9)</li>
<li>ThreadTwo (Prio : 10; Preemption Threshold : 10)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once started, the <b>MainThread</b> is suspended waiting for the
event flag. The <em>ThreadOne</em> starts to toggle the
<em>LED_GREEN</em> each 500ms and <b>ThreadTwo</b> cannot as its
priority is less than the <em>ThreadOne</em> threshold. After 5 seconds
it sends an event <em>THREAD_ONE_EVT</em> to the <b>MainThread</b>.</p>
<p>After receiving the <em>THREAD_ONE_EVT</em>, the <b>MainThread</b>
change the <b>ThreadTwo</b> priority to 8 and its preemption threshold
to 8 to be more than the <em>ThreadOne</em> threshold then waits for an
event.</p>
<p>Now, the <b>ThreadTwo</b> can preempt the <b>ThreadOne</b> and start
toggling the <em>LED_GREEN</em> each 200ms for 5 seconds. Once done it
send the <b>THREAD_TWO_EVT</b> to <b>MainThread</b>. Once
<em>ThreadTwo_Evt</em> is received, the <b>MainThread</b> resets the
<b>ThreadTwo</b> priority and preemption threshold to their original
values (10, 10), <b>ThreadOne</b> is rescheduled and the above scenario
is redone. After repeating the sequence above 3 times, the
<b>MainThread</b> should destroy <b>ThreadOne</b> and <b>ThreadTwo</b>
and toggles the <em>LED_GREEN</em> each 1 second for ever.</p>
<h4 id="expected-success-behavior"><b>Expected success behavior</b></h4>

<li>Before starting the application :</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The DDR memory need to be initialized with DDR_Init project.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="threadx-usage-hints"><b>ThreadX usage hints</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>ThreadX uses the Systick as time base, thus it is mandatory that the
HAL uses a separate time base through the TIM IPs.</li>
<li>ThreadX is configured with 100 ticks/sec by default, this should be
taken into account when using delays or timeouts at application. It is
always possible to reconfigure it in the “tx_user.h”, the
“TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND” define,but this should be reflected in
“tx_initialize_low_level.s” file too.</li>
<li>ThreadX is disabling all interrupts during kernel start-up to avoid
any unexpected behavior, therefore all system related calls (HAL, BSP)
should be done either at the beginning of the application or inside the
thread entry functions.</li>
<li>ThreadX offers the “tx_application_define()” function, that is
automatically called by the tx_kernel_enter() API. It is highly
recommended to use it to create all applications ThreadX related
resources (threads, semaphores, memory pools…) but it should not in any
way contain a system API call (HAL or BSP).</li>

<li>This example runs on STM32MP135xx devices</li>
<li>This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32MP135F-DK
boards. and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and
development board.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-use-it"><b>How to use it ?</b></h3>
<p>In order to make the program work, you must do the following :</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your preferred toolchain</li>
<li>Rebuid and run DDR_Init example to initialize the DDR memory</li>
<li>Rebuild all Tx_Thread_Creation_A7 application files and load your
image into target memory</li>
<li>Run the application</li>
</ul>
