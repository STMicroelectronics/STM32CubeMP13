<h2 id="ux_device_cdc_acm-application-description"><b>Ux_Device_CDC_ACM
application description </b></h2>
<p>This application provides an example of Azure RTOS USBX stack usage
on STM32MP135F-DK board, it shows how to develop USB Device
communication Class “CDC_ACM” based application. The application is
designed to emulate an USB-to-UART bridge following the Virtual COM Port
(VCP) implementation, the code provides all required device descriptors
framework and associated Class descriptor report to build a compliant
USB CDC_ACM device. At the beginning ThreadX call the entry function
tx_application_define(), at this stage, all USBx resources are
initialized, the CDC_ACM Class driver is registered and the application
creates 3 threads with the same priorities :</p>
<ul>
<li>usbx_app_thread_entry (Prio : 20; PreemptionPrio : 20) used to
initialize USB OTG HAL PCD driver and start the device.</li>
<li>usbx_cdc_acm_read_thread_entry (Prio : 20; PreemptionPrio : 20) used
to Read the received data from Virtual COM Port.</li>
<li>usbx_cdc_acm_write_thread_entry (Prio : 20; PreemptionPrio : 20)
used to send the received data over UART.</li>
</ul>
<p>During enumeration phase, three communication pipes “endpoints” are
declared in the CDC class implementation :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 x Bulk IN endpoint for receiving data from STM32 device to PC
host: When data are received over UART they are saved in the buffer
“UserTxBufferHS”. Periodically, in a usbx_cdc_acm_write_thread_entry the
state of the buffer “UserTxBufferHS” is checked. If there are available
data, they are transmitted in response to IN token otherwise it is
NAKed.</p></li>
<li><p>1 x Bulk OUT endpoint for transmitting data from PC host to STM32
device: When data are received through this endpoint they are saved in
the buffer “UserRxBufferFS” then they are transmitted over UART using
DMA mode and in meanwhile the OUT endpoint is NAKed. Once the
transmission is over, the OUT endpoint is prepared to receive next
packet in HAL_UART_RxCpltCallback().</p></li>
<li><p>1 x Interrupt IN endpoint for setting and getting serial-port
parameters: When control setup is received, the corresponding request is
executed in ux_app_parameters_change().</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this application, two requests are implemented:</p>
<pre><code>- Set line: Set the bit rate, number of Stop bits, parity, and number of data bits
- Get line: Get the bit rate, number of Stop bits, parity, and number of data bits</code></pre>
<p>The other requests (send break, control line state) are not
implemented.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The DDR memory need to be initialized with DDR_Init
project.</p></li>
<li><p>Receiving data over UART is handled by interrupt while
transmitting is handled by DMA allowing hence the application to receive
data at the same time it is transmitting another data (full- duplex
feature).</p></li>
<li><p>The user has to check the list of the COM ports in Device Manager
to find out the COM port number that have been assigned (by OS) to the
VCP interface.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="expected-success-behavior"><b>Expected success behavior</b></h4>
<p>When plugged to PC host, the STM32MP135F-DK must be properly
enumerated as an USB Serial device and an STlink Com port. During the
enumeration phase, the device must provide host with the requested
descriptors (Device descriptor, configuration descriptor, string
descriptors). Those descriptors are used by host driver to identify the
device capabilities. Once STM32MP135F-DK USB device successfully
completed the enumeration phase, Open two hyperterminals (USB com port
and UART com port(USB STLink VCP)) to send/receive data to/from host
from/to device.</p>
<h4 id="error-behaviors"><b>Error behaviors</b></h4>
<p>Host PC shows that USB device does not operate as designed (CDC

<h4 id="threadx-usage-hints"><b>ThreadX usage hints</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>ThreadX uses the Systick as time base, thus it is mandatory that the
HAL uses a separate time base through the TIM IPs.</li>
<li>ThreadX is configured with 100 ticks/sec by default, this should be
taken into account when using delays or timeouts at application. It is
always possible to reconfigure it in the “tx_user.h”, the
“TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND” define,but this should be reflected in
“tx_initialize_low_level.s” file too.</li>
<li>ThreadX is disabling all interrupts during kernel start-up to avoid
any unexpected behavior, therefore all system related calls (HAL, BSP)
should be done either at the beginning of the application or inside the
thread entry functions.</li>
<li>ThreadX offers the “tx_application_define()” function, that is
automatically called by the tx_kernel_enter() API. It is highly
recommended to use it to create all applications ThreadX related
resources (threads, semaphores, memory pools…) but it should not in any
way contain a system API call (HAL or BSP).</li>

<li>This example runs on STM32MP13xx devices</li>
<li>This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32MP135F-DK
board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and
development board.</li>
<li>STM32MP135F-DK Set-up</li>
<li>Connect the STM32MP135F-DK board CN7 to the PC through “MICRO-USB”
to “Standard A” cable.</li>
<li>For VCP the configuration is dynamic for example it can be :
<ul>
<li>BaudRate = 115200 baud</li>
<li>Word Length = 8 Bits</li>
<li>Stop Bit = 1</li>
<li>Parity = None</li>
<li>Flow control = None</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The UART4 interface available on PD6 and PD8 of the microprocessor
are connected to ST-LINK MPU. By default the UART4 communication between
the target MPU and ST-LINK MPU is enabled. It’s configuration is as
following:
<ul>
<li>BaudRate = 115200 baud</li>
<li>Word Length = 8 Bits</li>
<li>Stop Bit = 1</li>
<li>Parity = None</li>
<li>Flow control = None</li>
</ul></li>

<p>In order to make the program work, you must do the following :</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your preferred toolchain</li>
<li>Rebuild and run DDR_Init example to initialize the DDR memory</li>
<li>Rebuild all files of Ux_Device_CDC_ACM application and load your
