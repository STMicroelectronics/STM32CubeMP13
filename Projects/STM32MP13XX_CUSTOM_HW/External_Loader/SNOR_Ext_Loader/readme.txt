@par SNOR External Loader Firmware utility Description

SNOR External Loader Firmware utility is used to manage external SNOR flash
  - This utility provides embedded SW applications to program and manage 
    external SNOR flash on STM32MP13XX_CUSTOM_HW Board and has been tested for MX25L51245G Flash.
  - This package includes only binaries and supports UART and
    USB DFU protocol without more complex software on STM32MP13XX_CUSTOM_HW board.
  -	SNOR External Loader Firmware utility source code should be requested from STMicroelectronics and easily
    adapted and improved based on your own needs.
  - OTP Programming is not supported in this package.

This package contain CP_Serial_Boot mode that you can use with **WindowsÂ® PC**.
Please find below detail about CP_Serial_Boot mode described in this document.

Setup
  - Board with USB DFU or UART serial interface.
  - STM32CubeProgrammer PC tool installed (v2.14.0 minimum)
    . (https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/STM32CubeProgrammer_release_note)                                                                                                                     |                                |                                                            |                                                                                                      |      X      |

How to Use CP_Serial_Boot

   - In this section, you will use 
     "Projects\STM32MP13XX_CUSTOM_HW\External_Loader\SNOR_Ext_Loader" directory 
     containing SNOR External Loader binaries and a tsv file used by STM32CubeProgrammer.

SNOR External Loader contents
   - FlashLayout_OpenBL_ExtLoaderSNOR_SerialBoot.tsv
     . It contains details about binaries, their type etc and is used by STM32CubeProgrammer 
	   for programming the binaries.
	   
   - FSBLA_SNOR_A7_Signed.bin
     . This is the First Stage BootLoader which will be programmed via STM32PRGFW_UTIL_MP13xx_CP_Serial_Boot.stm32
	   in SNOR and will be used for loading test application from SNOR to DDR.
	   
   - MP13_BSP_TemplatesA7_CUSTOM_HW_Signed.bin
     . This is the test application, which will be programmed in SNOR and then loaded in DDR
       for execution. This can be replaced with any test application used by customer and customer application has 
	   to built and properly signed with CubeProgrammer/signing tool ( or via Postbuild script).
   
   - MX25L51245G_STM32MP135C-CUSTOM_HW_A7.bin
     . This is used for programming XSPI based SNOR flash.
	 
   - STM32PRGFW_UTIL_MP13xx_CP_Serial_Boot.stm32
     . This utilises MX25L51245G_STM32MP135C-CUSTOM_HW_A7.bin and FSBLA_SNOR_A7_Signed.bin for  
	   programming SNOR, loading and execution from DDR respectively.

Hardware prerequisites

  - Set boot boot pins to b000 (BOOT0/1/2 to OFF) position to select 
    [serial boot]
	(https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/STM32_MPU_ROM_code_overview#Boot_device_selection)
  - If you want to use USB DFU interface
    . connect USB cable between PC and the board. PC should detect USB DFU interface.
  - If you want to use UART interface
    . connect UART cable between PC and the board. PC should detect UART interface.
      NOTE: could be STLink connector if Virtual COM port is connected on the board 
	  like ST DISCOVERY boards.
      NOTE: USB cable should not be connected if you want to use UART !!! - ROM CODE 
	  will use USB DFU if both interface are available!

STM32CubeProgrammer GUI interface

Please Read STM32CubeProgrammer user manual for further details if needed

  - Select Port (USB or UART) depending on how you want to program the memories.
  - Click on Connect button - STM32CubeProgrammer is now connected to ROM Code
  - Select TSV 
    . Firmware\Projects\STM32MP13XX_CUSTOM_HW\External_Loader\SNOR_Ext_Loader\FlashLayout_OpenBL_ExtLoaderSNOR_SerialBoot.tsv
  - Select Binary Path with Browse Button : Firmware\Projects\STM32MP13XX_CUSTOM_HW\External_Loader\SNOR_Ext_Loader
  - Click on Download - STM32CubeProgrammer is now connected to SNOR External Loader firmware
    and started downloading the binaries.

STM32CubeProgrammer CLI interface

Please Read STM32CubeProgrammer user manual for further details if needed

  - Go to the STM32CubeProgrammer binary directory (i.e. STM32CubeProgrammer\bin)
  - Open command prompt inside this bin directory
  - Run below command to load the SNOR External Loader binaries in the embedded RAM:
    UART : $STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=COM <num> -w <Your Directory Path>\Projects\<STM32 device>\External_Loader\SNOR_Ext_Loader\FlashLayout_OpenBL_ExtLoaderSNOR_SerialBoot.tsv
	USB : $STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=USB <num> -w <Your Directory Path>\Projects\<STM32 device>\External_Loader\SNOR_Ext_Loader\FlashLayout_OpenBL_ExtLoaderSNOR_SerialBoot.tsv 
  - Do not reset the board till the command has completed.
  
Test Application Output
  - After all the binaries are loaded successfully, set boot boot pins to b001 (BOOT0/1 to OFF and BOOT2 to ON) position to select 
    [SNOR boot]https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/STM32_MPU_ROM_code_overview#Boot_device_selection) and reset.
  - Blue LED toggles at 200ms rate, indicating that test application loading and execution is successful.
